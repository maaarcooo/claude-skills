# Revision Notes Generator

Generate concise, accurate revision notes from PDF or Markdown content in markdown format.

## Process

1. Read the source PDF or Markdown file thoroughly
2. Identify all key content: **bolded terms**, highlighted text, and Higher Tier material
3. Verify accuracy of all information in the source — correct any errors
4. Write concise notes covering all essential topic knowledge
5. Output as markdown file with the specified title

## Writing Guidelines

**Concise**: Condense information to essential points. Remove filler and redundancy.

**Complete**: Cover all necessary knowledge for the topic. Don't omit key concepts.

**Accurate**: Cross-check facts against your knowledge. Flag or correct any errors in the source material.

**Structured**: Use clear headings and logical organisation. Group related concepts.

**Higher Tier**: Clearly include all Higher Tier content — optionally mark with (HT) if helpful.

## Output Format

Markdown file with:
- Title as H1 heading (use exact title specified by user)
- Logical section headings (H2/H3)
- Key terms in **bold**
- Equations/formulas in code blocks or LaTeX where appropriate
- Concise bullet points or short paragraphs

**Exclude**: Specification/syllabus reference codes (e.g., "1.1.3 a)", "1.1.3 b)"). These clutter the notes — focus only on the actual knowledge content.

## Example Structure

```markdown
# [Topic Title]

## Key Concepts

**Term**: Definition.

## Section Name

Core explanation in concise form.

- Key point one
- Key point two (HT)

## Equations

`formula = expression`
```
